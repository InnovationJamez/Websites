		For this project I would like to build a game using Unity software. 
		Game development has been an interest of mine. In high school I took 
		a game design class and I learned about the basics of game theory. I 
		will be able to apply my knowledge of programming and game design to 
		creating a game. Knowledge of Unity will be very useful if I go into 
		the game industry because it is very widely used for game development. 
		The most important skill I would gain from this project would be the 
		ability to learn new programming languages quickly. This skill is 
		important as different jobs will all use different languages and I 
		will need to learn how to use them quickly to be an effective worker.

		<p>
		The videogame industry is very big and is very profitable. There are 
		one hundred twenty-five million steam accounts. Posting a game on
		steam and if it becomes popular it will be very profitable. If I were
		to go into the videogame industry having relevant experience would be
		very helpful when applying for a job. Also, I can show them this 
		project as an example of my past work. This project will be very 
		interesting because I have never used Unity software before and I 
		would like to learn how to use it. Knowledge of Unity will be very 
		useful as many game development studios use this software.

		I have an interest in game design and I know about programming. For this project I would 
		like to build a game using jave or C++. The game would be a platft

		The first thing I will need is a computer which I will use to create 
		the game. I will be using my laptop as it will be good enough to make 
		a game with two-dimensional graphics. The software I will be using to
		make the game is Unity. To use Unity, I will need to learn how to 
		program with C#. There is a free version of Unity available to 
		download online. Drawing programs such as paint can be used for the 
		art design and I can use music making software for the in-game sounds. 
		This software can be found online, and lite versions can be downloaded 
		for free.

		<p>
		The Unity program uses C# which I will need to learn to use the software. 
		I will also need to learn how to use the other features of Unity as well.
		For the visual element of the game I will need to learn how to draw. Also,
		for the audio I will need to learn how to use audio editing software and
		music software. I already know how to program with C and C++ so learning 
		C# should not take too long. I do not have that much experience drawing,
		but I can learn to draw simple characters and backgrounds. I have no Idea
		how to make music, but I can probably make some very stock or generic 
		tracks.

		<p>
		My fist goal is to finish the game and for it to run without any glitches 
		or the game crashing. For the game to be successful it will be a game in 
		complete working condition and it will be available on an online 
		distribution service such as steam, google play, or iOS store. The game 
		will be more successful if it sells a lot and it makes a lot of money. 
		The least I will get out of this project is that I will be able to put 
		this in my resume as relevant experience for future jobs. Also, the 
		knowledge I will have gained will be useful If I go into the game 
		industry in the future.
